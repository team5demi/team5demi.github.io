            <p>
                This week, we met with JPL to discuss a couple action items: first, mechanical design changes regarding the capture method itself; second, optimal (and feasible) sensor systems; and third, testing methods available to us as university students.

                <br>
                We came up with a new mailbox-esque design for enveloping space debris and pushing it through an aperture. This would replace the “petal” approach we had developed last semester. We decided to revisit the design because it was unlikely that we would be able to manufacture a full-scale prototype out of aluminum given the tools available to us.
                <br>
                We reached out to Velodyne to seek out a potential partnership or guidance regarding how to implement a LIDAR system into our capture mechanism. If a LIDAR system is infeasible in our timeframe/budget, we have discussed a few alternatives, including thermal IR imaging and computer vision systems.
                <br>
                In terms of testing mechanisms, JPL advised us to test underwater, if possible. This does introduce some complexity in waterproofing our electronics, but we will revisit this possibility once we have finalized our design.

                The team is work on creating a game plan for the project.
                Currently, we are trying to decide whether to continue with the 
                exsiting plan or go in a different direction. Currently, we have
                a 1 degree of freedom outer grabber that uses a rail-peg system to 
                articulate. The team expresses concerns about how to manufacture these
                parts and also how to make the mechanism robust enough to handle 
                the operation at a much larger scale. We have discussed what the
                sensing capabilies are required for our operation and plan to discuss
                with JPL about our choices.
                <br>
                Next week: Meet with JPL to discuss our concerns and create a clear path
                for the development of our mechanism.
