            </h2>
            <p>
                Nico Aldana is a mechanical engineering student with an interest in bionics, 
                accessibility technology, and entrepreneurship. Nico’s introduction to aerospace engineering was 
                before his time at Columbia, when he was named a Virginia Aerospace Science & Technology Scholar 
                and spent a summer at the NASA Langley Research Center. His interest in entrepreneurship began as a 
                result of the MIT Launch program, a startup incubator hosted in Cambridge, MA, where he worked on 
                a team that aimed to make driving safer and more accessible to teens with attention deficit disorders. 
                During the school year, Nico volunteered with NOVA Pride to put on Pride Prom, an annual charity event 
                for high school students of all identities to feel safe and included.
                <br><br>After beginning his engineering career at Columbia, Nico pivoted to focus on human-centered design, 
                showing more interest in healthcare, accessibility, and infrastructure. He interned at Sonar, a new startup 
                that is committed to providing accurate and reliable medical data for consumers. He also explored the 
                possibilities of machine learning and software engineering at Cream, a Melbourne-based startup that aims 
                to directly connect customers with disabilities to restaurants willing to accommodate their needs.
                <br><br>For Nico, DEMI was a fulfilling project to end his time as a Columbia student. Upon graduation, 
                Nico hopes to broaden his horizons as an engineer before returning to New York City.

                Miles Huntley-Fenner
            </h2>
            <p>
                Miles Huntley-Fenner is an accomplished Mechanical Engineering student and passionate spaceflight enthusiast.
                 As a high school student, he advocated for, designed, and built a CubeSat which successfully launched 
                 into low Earth orbit in 2018. As a student at Columbia University, he participated in the Columbia Space 
                 Initiative, which engages in NASA design challenges. He designed, prototyped, and tested a lunar anchoring 
                 device which was later demonstrated at the Johnson Space Center’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab to positive reviews.
                  As an intern at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), he did design and prototype work for Mars Sample Return – 
                  a campaign to return samples from the red planet – as well as CLING – which is a CubeSat docking mission 
                  slated to fly aboard the International Space Station. He also worked on the RF slice of a modular spacecraft
                   bus system intended for use aboard a variety of missions. As a senior, he worked through the JPL University 
                   Crowdsourcing Initiative (JUCI) to organize a dual function JUCI senior capstone team which has since devoted
                    itself to the capture of space junk in low Earth orbit. After graduation, Miles will be returning to NASA 
                    full time as a Systems Engineer at JPL. Miles prides himself on his humor, communication, sartorial style, 
                    and his ability to build capable and diverse teams.

            <h2>
                Yidi Reiss
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yidi Reiss is a motivated Mechanical Engineering student with a 
                passion for spaceflight and the maker community. Before attending Columbia University, 
                he studied applied mathematics at Queens College where he was introduced to 3D printing through 
                the Makerspace. He later interned there, where he learned CAD and built two quadruped robots. 
                While at the makerspace, Yidi partnered with the Harlem Launch Alliance to fly two rockets in 
                order to receive his L1 and L2 High Powered Rocketry certification.

                <br><br>At Columbia, Yidi has been a part of and led multiple diverse teams. He led an interdisciplinary 
                team to ease the burden on postpartum mothers, designed and built the fastest walking robot in his 
                Robotic Studio course, and started a business selling custom 3D printed judaica. After graduating, 
                he will be a mechanical lead at Private Machines, working on tamper-resistant computing devices.

                <br><br>Yidi's love for spaceflight started when he watched SpaceX attempting to land their falcon 9 booster.
                 He followed the program until the first successful landing and expanded his interest to all areas of 
                 spaceflight. Yidi has been involved in the spaceflight community since then and was excited to work on 
                 DEMI, tackling one of the biggest challenges affecting spaceflight today.
