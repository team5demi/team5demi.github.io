                Leon Aharonian
            </h2>
            <p>
                Leon Aharonian just graduated from Columbia University with a major in Mechanical Engineering 
                and a minor in Computer Science. As an active member and project leader on his High School FIRST 
                robotics team he developed a strong foundation for teamwork and gained experience with CAD, machining 
                and assembly of national championship worthy robots. He also spent 2.5 years working at Columbia’s 
                Robotics and Rehabilitation Lab where he created a comfortable Posture Monitoring Shirt (PoMS) that 
                used Machine Learning to generate posture-defining coordinate transforms based on electrical resistance 
                from stretch sensors. He also taught a 35 student summer enrichment course at his high school on the 
                basics of CAD and 3D design.

                <br><br>At Columbia he contributed to several design projects. For his robotics studio course he built 
                a walking bipedal robot out of printed PLA and laser cut acrylic and programmed its servos to run off a 
                Raspberry Pi. As a research student in the Creative Machines Lab he designed a data pillow for the elderly 
                to monitor their vitals and notify emergency services if needed. He worked in a team to design, build, and 
                control a complex linkage mechanism to press arcade buttons in sequence as quickly as possible. He also worked 
                on several coding based design projects for digital manufacturing such as programmable embroidery and food 
                printing. And Finally, he played a key role in the design and fabrication of DEMI.

                <br><br>In his free time Leon loves to ski, whitewater kayak, and escape into nature for crazy adventures. 
                He has also worked as a raft guide and video boater on class 3-4 whitewater.

                Nicolas Aldana
            </h2>
            <p>
                Nico Aldana is a mechanical engineering student with an interest in bionics, 
                accessibility technology, and entrepreneurship. Nico’s introduction to aerospace engineering was 
                before his time at Columbia, when he was named a Virginia Aerospace Science & Technology Scholar 
                and spent a summer at the NASA Langley Research Center. His interest in entrepreneurship began as a 
                result of the MIT Launch program, a startup incubator hosted in Cambridge, MA, where he worked on 
                a team that aimed to make driving safer and more accessible to teens with attention deficit disorders. 
                During the school year, Nico volunteered with NOVA Pride to put on Pride Prom, an annual charity event 
                for high school students of all identities to feel safe and included.
                <br><br>After beginning his engineering career at Columbia, Nico pivoted to focus on human-centered design, 
                showing more interest in healthcare, accessibility, and infrastructure. He interned at Sonar, a new startup 
                that is committed to providing accurate and reliable medical data for consumers. He also explored the 
                possibilities of machine learning and software engineering at Cream, a Melbourne-based startup that aims 
                to directly connect customers with disabilities to restaurants willing to accommodate their needs.
                <br><br>For Nico, DEMI was a fulfilling project to end his time as a Columbia student. Upon graduation, 
                Nico hopes to broaden his horizons as an engineer before returning to New York City.

                Miles Huntley-Fenner
            </h2>
            <p>
                Miles Huntley-Fenner is an accomplished Mechanical Engineering student and passionate spaceflight enthusiast. 
                As a high school student, he advocated for, designed, and built a CubeSat which successfully launched into 
                low Earth orbit in 2018.
                <br><br>As a student at Columbia University, he participated in the Columbia Space Initiative, which engages 
                in NASA design challenges. He designed, prototyped, and tested a lunar anchoring device which was later 
                demonstrated at the Johnson Space Center’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab to positive reviews. 
                <br><br>As an intern at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), he did design and prototype work for Mars Sample 
                Return – a campaign to return samples from the red planet – as well as CLING – which is a CubeSat docking 
                mission slated to fly aboard the International Space Station. He also worked on the RF slice of a modular 
                spacecraft bus system intended for use aboard a variety of missions. As a senior, he worked through the JPL 
                University Crowdsourcing Initiative (JUCI) to organize a dual function JUCI senior capstone team which has 
                since devoted itself to the capture of space junk in low Earth orbit. 
                <br><br>After graduation, Miles will be returning to NASA full time as a Systems Engineer at JPL. Miles prides 
                himself on his humor, communication, sartorial style, and his ability to build capable and diverse teams.

                Yidi Reiss
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yidi Reiss is a motivated Mechanical Engineering student with a 
                passion for spaceflight and the maker community. Before attending Columbia University, 
                he studied applied mathematics at Queens College where he was introduced to 3D printing through 
                the Makerspace. He later interned there, where he learned CAD and built two quadruped robots. 
                While at the makerspace, Yidi partnered with the Harlem Launch Alliance to fly two rockets in 
                order to receive his L1 and L2 High Powered Rocketry certification.

                <br><br>At Columbia, Yidi has been a part of and led multiple diverse teams. He led an interdisciplinary 
                team to ease the burden on postpartum mothers, designed and built the fastest walking robot in his 
                Robotic Studio course, and started a business selling custom 3D printed judaica. After graduating, 
                he will be a mechanical lead at Private Machines, working on tamper-resistant computing devices.

                <br><br>Yidi's love for spaceflight started when he watched SpaceX attempting to land their falcon 9 booster.
                 He followed the program until the first successful landing and expanded his interest to all areas of 
                 spaceflight. Yidi has been involved in the spaceflight community since then and was excited to work on 
                 DEMI, tackling one of the biggest challenges affecting spaceflight today.

                Christina Wright
            </h2>
            <p>
                Christina Wright is a passionate mechanical engineer with interest in robotics, design, and finding 
                creative solutions to engineering problems. She began working with 3D printers in high school, which 
                built her interest in mechanical engineering. At Columbia, she has created several projects that have 
                grown her ability to code, use CAD software, and design mechanisms. This includes a bipedal walking robot 
                and her work assisting in research to develop a new 3D printing technology in the Creative Machines Lab at 
                Columbia. Christina has also worked in educational spaces for children, acting as the technician for a maker
                 space, designing unique projects as educational tools, and developing a curriculum to teach stem concepts.

                <br><br>As the president of Columbia’s fiber arts club Gosh Yarn It, Christina has created a collaborative
                 space where people can express their creativity, learn new skills, and meet people with similar interests, 
                 but different academic backgrounds. Through this experience, she learned how to teach others and break down
                  complicated techniques into approachable instruction. She hopes to pursue opportunities that bring together 
                  her creative passions and engineering knowledge.

                <br><br>In her free time, Christina loves to knit, read and watch movies. She also likes to try new athletic
                 activities like one-wheeling and squash, and she plans to learn to play pickleball this summer.
