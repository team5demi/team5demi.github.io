                    The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that 
                    progressively gets more difficult as it continues. 
                    The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. 
                    Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets 
                    faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap 
                    should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] 
                    Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. 
                    The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your 
                    test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark,
                     get ready, start.

                     According to all known laws
                     of aviation,
                     there is no way a bee
                     should be able to fly.
                     Its wings are too small to get
                     its fat little body off the ground.  
                     The bee, of course, flies anyway 
                     because bees don't care
                     what humans think is impossible.  
                     Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. 
                     Ooh, black and yellow!
                     Let's shake it up a little.
                     Barry! Breakfast is ready! 
                     Ooming! 
                     Hang on a second.  
                     Hello?
                     - Barry?
                     - Adam? 
                     - Oan you believe this is happening?
                     - I can't. I'll pick you up.
                     Looking sharp.
                     Use the stairs. Your father
                     paid good money for those. 
                     Sorry. I'm excited. 
                     Here's the graduate.
                     We're very proud of you, son. 
                     A perfect report card, all B's.
                     
                       
                     Very proud.
                     
                       
                     Ma! I got a thing going here.
                     
                       
                     - You got lint on your fuzz.
                     - Ow! That's me!
                     
                       
                     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
                     - Bye!
                     
                       
                     Barry, I told you,
                     stop flying in the house!
                     
                       
                     - Hey, Adam.
                     - Hey, Barry.
                     
                       
                     - Is that fuzz gel?
                     - A little. Special day, graduation.
                     
                       
                     Never thought I'd make it.
                     
                       
                     Three days grade school,
                     three days high school.
                     
                       
                     Those were awkward.
                     
                       
                     Three days college. I'm glad I took
                     a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
